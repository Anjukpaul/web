">In today’s car market in India, there are so many options when it comes to size, style and shape. Car manufacturers in
 India are researching and developing different types of cars to suit the varied needs of the Indian customer.</p></h3>
<h2><b>Types of Cars</b></h2>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">Below are the types of cars available in the Indian market along with examples to help you understand them better:</p></h3><br>

<h2>Hatchback:</h2>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">This type of car is a small car with a rear door which opens upwards revealing the boot space to keep your luggage. Excluding 
the rear door, hatchbacks are built with four-doors, while two-door hatchbacks are also available in the market. Most hatchbacks use 
the front-wheel drivetrain to propel the vehicle, while performance-oriented hatchbacks can be either a rear-wheel or front-wheel drive.</p></h3> 

<h2>Sedan/Saloon/Notchback:</h2>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">The main feature of a sedan is that it is designed with separate passenger and boot space. Sedans feature four-doors and a boot or trunk. 
A sedan is designed as a 3-box configuration vehicle — engine, passenger and cargo. The word sedan is used in American English, while 
the word saloon is used in British English.</h3></p>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">As for notchbacks, these are sedans with a less pronounced boot or trunk space. They are sedans with a hatchback rear. Apart from 
notchbacks, sedans can be further sub-categorised as fastback, compact or subcompact.</h3></p>

<h2>Compact Sedan:</h2>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">The Indian car market is complex and the needs of customers are sometimes different compared to other countries. One such is 
the compact cars. These cars measure less than four-metres in length and enjoy tax benefits from the Indian government.</h3></p>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">To take advantage of the pricing factor, Indian car manufacturers developed car body types which are exclusive to India. 
The compact sedan is one such exclusive type of car. While these cars look like a sedan with four-doors and a boot or 
trunk, space is much lesser compared to the regular sedan.</h3></p>

<h2>Coupe:</h2>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">A coupe is a two-door car with a sloping roofline, giving it a sporty stance. Most of these coupes come with a po
werful engine and feature two-seats or come with smaller rear seats. However, in recent times, coupes are designed 
with four-doors while its characteristics remain sporty in nature.</h3></p> 

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">While this type of car is not the preferred choice by the masses in India, there are global manufacturers selling this 
type of cars in India for a small category of drivers.</h3></p>

<h2>Micro Car:</h2>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">Car manufacturers strive to offer a good product which is both inexpensive and practical to drive, especially in 
developing countries. Micro-cars have the advantage of cheaper running costs yet offer the convenience of a four-wheeler. </h3></p>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">While luxury car makers offer microcars which are super compact with a powerful engine, they are expensive. In India, to 
make cars affordable, carmakers developed microcars exclusive to India.</h3></p>

<h2>Crossover Hatchback:</h2>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">These types of cars are essentially hatchbacks with an exterior and feel of an SUV but do not qualify to be called an SUV. The 
Indian market is competitive and customers prefer a compact or a small four-wheeler but with an SUV design language.</h3></p>

<h2>MPV/Minivan:</h2>

<h3><p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 15px
">MPV or Multi-Purpose Vehicles are people carriers and designed to offer more space and seats with either two, three or more rows of 
seating. This type of vehicle is also called MUV (Multi-Utility Vehicle). MPVs are usually designed like a van for maximum interior spa<ce.</h3></p>
